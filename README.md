## Azure and Databricks Projects
<img align="left" width="200" src="https://github.com/AU636523/wholesale-recommender-azure/blob/main/images/thumb.png?raw=true"> 

**Work in progress:** **[Wholesale Recommender Engine](https://github.com/AU636523/wholesale-recommender-azure)**
An end-to-end recommendation engine built on the Azure stack, simulating a B2B use case. It includes customer-specific and item-based recommendations, a Dash-powered internal dashboard.

I wish to demonstrate my skills on the Azure and Databricks platform through this project which I have tried to make as close to real production as possible without data from a real organization.

To make it as realistic as possible, I have asked ChatGPT 4o to act as my product owner and provide me with user stories. From these I have listed features I wish to include in a MVP.

## Academic Projects

<img align="left" width="200" src="https://github.com/AU636523/glioblastoma-recurrence-patterns/blob/main/images/thumb.png?raw=true"> 

**[Glioblastoma Recurrence Pattern Classification](https://github.com/AU636523/glioblastoma-recurrence-patterns)**

**Master thesis research project** in collaboration with Danish Center for Particle Therapy at Aarhus University Hospital.
<br>**Graded**: 12 (A)

**Description**: In the project we extracted features from 3D MRI imaging at unique time points using both machine learning and morphological techniques and finally used them to investigate the patterns of GBM-tumour recurrence. 

**Gained experience with**: Python, PyTorch, radiomics, ML experiment management, preprocessing pipelines, 3D data, Unet, pretrained models, dimensionality reduction, docker, git

**[Leak Detection in Smart Water Meters](https://github.com/AU636523/leak-detection-smart-watermeters)**

**Bachelor thesis project** in collaboration with Apator Miitors ApS
<br>**Graded**: 10 (B)

**Description**: We investigated water leakage localization in modern water distribution systems using the smart water meter Ultrimis-W. The classification was performed based on data collected using a custom build device with measurement microphones, MEMS microphones, piezo transducers, and accelerometers, to analyze the impact of leakages on features in the time- and frequency domain. The methods for classification was compared in relation to power consumption and a framework for a future implementation was proposed. 

**Gained experience with**: Python, time series features, classification models, data collection

**[Using Generated Images to Improve Crowd Counting](https://github.com/AU636523/Using_Generated_Images_in_Crowd_Counting)**

**Academic project** as part of the 10 ECTS project-based course: Computer Vision
<br> **Graded**: 12 (A)

**Description**: In collaboration with two fellow students, we propose a novel synthetic image generation method to improve crowd counting computer vision algorithms. The method we propose generates images based on segmentation maps with 1) generic classes, such as buildings, treeâ€™s, cars etc. and 2) classes of crowds with varying density. In this way we first define the crowd densities (ground truth) and use that to train a GAN-architecture.

**Gained experience with**: Python, PyTorch, Docker, Git, Computer vision, generative AI, transfer learning, Unet

## Academic Mini Projects


<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/AU636523/salmon-price-forecasting/blob/main/images/thumb.png?raw=true"> 

**[Norwegian Salmon Price Forecasting](https://github.com/AU636523/salmon-price-forecasting)**

This project explores whether future recurrence patterns of glioblastoma can be predicted from the original tumor on T1ce MRI using machine learning. The full pipeline includes preprocessing, UNet-based segmentation, radiomic extraction, PCA/autoencoders, and classification via XGBoost and MLP. Despite rigorous modeling on the largest known GBM recurrence dataset, no predictive signal was found.

**[Surviving the Teenage Years Without Smoking Marijuana](https://github.com/AU636523/teen-marijuana-survival-analysis)**

This project uses survival analysis on NSDUH data to model the risk factors influencing teenage marijuana initiation. Classical methods like Kaplan-Meier and Cox PH were paired with ML models like Random Survival Forest and XGBSE to assess behavioral and socioeconomic predictors of early use.
